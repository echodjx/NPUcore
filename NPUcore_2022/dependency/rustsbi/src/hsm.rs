/// Hart State Management Extension
///
/// The Hart State Management (HSM) Extension introduces a set hart states and a set of functions
/// which allow the supervisor-mode software to request a hart state change.
///
/// # Hart states
///
/// The possible hart states along with a unique State ID are as follows:
///
/// | State ID | State Name | Description
/// |:---------|:-----------|:------------
/// | 0 | STARTED | The hart is physically powered-up and executing normally.
/// | 1 | STOPPED | The hart is not executing in supervisor-mode or any lower privilege mode. It is probably powered-down by the SBI implementation if the underlying platform has a mechanism to physically power-down harts.
/// | 2 | START_PENDING | Some other hart has requested to start (or power-up) the hart from the **STOPPED** state and the SBI implementation is still working to get the hart in the **STARTED** state.
/// | 3 | STOP_PENDING | The hart has requested to stop (or power-down) itself from the STARTED state and the SBI implementation is still working to get the hart in the **STOPPED** state.
/// | 4 | SUSPENDED | This hart is in a platform specific suspend (or low power) state.
/// | 5 | SUSPEND_PENDING | The hart has requestd to put itself in a platform specific low power state from the **STARTED** state and the SBI implementation is still working to get the hart in the platform specific **SUSPENDED** state.
/// | 6 | RESUME_PENDING | An interrupt or platform specific hardware event has caused the hart to resume normal execution from the **SUSPENDED** state and the SBI implementation is still working to get the hart in the **STARTED** state.
///
/// At any point in time, a hart should be in one of the above mentioned hart states.
///
/// # Topology hart groups
///
/// A platform can have multiple harts grouped into a hierarchical topology groups (namely cores, clusters, nodes, etc)
/// with separate platform specific low-power states for each hierarchical group.
/// These platform specific low-power states of hierarchial topology groups can be represented as platform specific suspend states of a hart.
/// A SBI implementation can utilize the suspend states of higher topology groups using one of the following approaches:
///
/// 1. *Platform-coordinated:* In this approach, when a hart becomes idle the supervisor-mode power-managment software
///   will request deepest suspend state for the hart and higher topology groups.
///   A SBI implementation should choose a suspend state at higher topology group which is:
/// - Not deeper than the specified suspend state
/// - Wake-up latency is not higher than the wake-up latency of the specified suspend state
/// 2. *OS-inititated:* In this approach, the supervisor-mode power-managment software will directly request a suspend state
///   for higher topology group after the last hart in that group becomes idle.
///   When a hart becomes idle, the supervisor-mode power-managment software will always select suspend state for the hart itself
///   but it will select a suspend state for a higher topology group only if the hart is the last running hart in the group.
///   A SBI implementation should:
/// - Never choose a suspend state for higher topology group different from the specified suspend state
/// - Always prefer most recent suspend state requested for higher topology group
///

    /// This call is asynchronous - more specifically, the `sbi_hart_start()` may return before target hart
    /// starts executing as long as the SBI implemenation is capable of ensuring the return code is accurate.
    ///
    /// It is recommended that if the SBI implementation is a platform runtime firmware executing in machine-mode (M-mode)
