//! Blocking I2C API
//!
//! This API supports 7-bit and 10-bit addresses. Traits feature an `AddressMode`
//! marker type parameter. Two implementation of the `AddressMode` exist:
//! `SevenBitAddress` and `TenBitAddress`.
//!
//! Through this marker types it is possible to implement each address mode for
//! the traits independently in `embedded-hal` implementations and device drivers
//! can depend only on the mode that they support.
//!
//! Additionally, the I2C 10-bit address mode has been developed to be fully
//! backwards compatible with the 7-bit address mode. This allows for a
//! software-emulated 10-bit addressing implementation if the address mode
//! is not supported by the hardware.
//!
//! Since 7-bit addressing is the mode of the majority of I2C devices,
//! `SevenBitAddress` has been set as default mode and thus can be omitted if desired.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ### `embedded-hal` implementation for an MCU
//! Here is an example of an embedded-hal implementation of the `Write` trait
//! for both modes:
//! ```
//! # use embedded_hal::i2c::{ErrorKind, ErrorType, SevenBitAddress, TenBitAddress, blocking::{I2c, Operation}};
//! /// I2C0 hardware peripheral which supports both 7-bit and 10-bit addressing.
//! pub struct I2c0;
//!
//! # impl ErrorType for I2c0 { type Error = ErrorKind; }
//! impl I2c<SevenBitAddress> for I2c0
//! {
//!     fn read(&mut self, addr: u8, buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn write(&mut self, addr: u8, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn write_iter<B: IntoIterator<Item = u8>>(&mut self, addr: u8, bytes: B) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn write_read(&mut self, addr: u8, bytes: &[u8], buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn write_iter_read<B: IntoIterator<Item = u8>>(&mut self, addr: u8, bytes: B, buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn transaction<'a>(&mut self, address: u8, operations: &mut [Operation<'a>]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn transaction_iter<'a, O: IntoIterator<Item = Operation<'a>>>(&mut self, address: u8, operations: O) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl I2c<TenBitAddress> for I2c0
//! {
//!     fn read(&mut self, addr: u16, buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn write(&mut self, addr: u16, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn write_iter<B: IntoIterator<Item = u8>>(&mut self, addr: u16, bytes: B) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn write_read(&mut self, addr: u16, bytes: &[u8], buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn write_iter_read<B: IntoIterator<Item = u8>>(&mut self, addr: u16, bytes: B, buffer: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn transaction<'a>(&mut self, address: u16, operations: &mut [Operation<'a>]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//!     fn transaction_iter<'a, O: IntoIterator<Item = Operation<'a>>>(&mut self, address: u16, operations: O) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         // ...
//! #       Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Device driver compatible only with 7-bit addresses
//!
//! For demonstration purposes the address mode parameter has been omitted in this example.
//!
//! ```
//! # use embedded_hal::i2c::{blocking::I2c, Error};
//! const ADDR: u8  = 0x15;
//! # const TEMP_REGISTER: u8 = 0x1;
//! pub struct TemperatureSensorDriver<I2C> {
//!     i2c: I2C,
//! }
//!
//! impl<I2C, E: Error> TemperatureSensorDriver<I2C>
//! where
//!     I2C: I2c<Error = E>,
//! {
//!     pub fn read_temperature(&mut self) -> Result<u8, E> {
//!         let mut temp = [0];
//!         self.i2c
//!             .write_read(ADDR, &[TEMP_REGISTER], &mut temp)
//!             .and(Ok(temp[0]))
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Device driver compatible only with 10-bit addresses
//!
//! ```
//! # use embedded_hal::i2c::{Error, TenBitAddress, blocking::I2c};
//! const ADDR: u16  = 0x158;
//! # const TEMP_REGISTER: u8 = 0x1;
//! pub struct TemperatureSensorDriver<I2C> {

//!     I2C: I2c<TenBitAddress, Error = E>,
//! {
//!     pub fn read_temperature(&mut self) -> Result<u8, E> {
//!         let mut temp = [0];
//!         self.i2c
//!             .write_read(ADDR, &[TEMP_REGISTER], &mut temp)
//!             .and(Ok(temp[0]))
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
